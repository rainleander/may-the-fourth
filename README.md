# May the Fourth: Jedi Training

Welcome to the May the Fourth Jedi Training repository! In the Star Wars universe, Jedi Knights are skilled in the use of the Force, a mystical energy that they can manipulate to achieve various abilities. This project simulates Jedi training by creating a Python program that generates a sequence of numbers and applies various transformations to them using... the power of code!

## Description

The `may.py` script generates a sequence of 10 random numbers between 1 and 10 and applies the following transformations:

1. Multiply every even number by 2
2. Add 5 to every odd number
3. Replace any number greater than 10 with 1

Finally, the program prints the final transformed sequence to the console.

## Execution

To run the script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/rainleander/may-the-fourth.git
```

2. Change directory to the cloned repository:

```
cd may-the-fourth
```

3. Run the script using Python:

```
python may.py
```

The script will output the final transformed sequence of numbers.
